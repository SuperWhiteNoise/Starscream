# Introduction

Starscream! 

What is it? A Discord bot
What can it do? GET crypto information from api.coingecko.com/api/v3
How? Like a typical discord bot, it uses a prefixed command to trigger the GET request and send back a message

# Setup

There is no special setup for the API

I use PM2 to run the bot
